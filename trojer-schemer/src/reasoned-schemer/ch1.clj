;;https://github.com/clojure/core.logic/wiki/Differences-from-The-Reasoned-Schemer

;;Read first paragraphs of http://www.clojure.net/2012/10/02/More-core.logic/
;;for a concise definition of "goals":
;;"when you unify two things, you
;;establish a relationship between then.
;;A collection of these relationships is
;;called a ‘substitution’. A goal is a
;;function that takes a substitution
;;as a parameter and adds one or more
;;relationships to it."

;;TRS (The Reasoned Schemer):
;;"In order to do relational program-
;;ming,we need only two constants:
;;  #s and #u,
;;and only three operators:
;;  ==, fresh, and conde."
;;core.logic:
;;s# and ué are functions, not constants

;;" #s and #u are reminiscent of the
;;Boolean constants #t and #f in Scheme"
