;;https://github.com/clojure/core.logic/wiki/Differences-from-The-Reasoned-Schemer

;;Read first paragraphs of http://www.clojure.net/2012/10/02/More-core.logic/
;;for a concise definition of "goals":
;;"when you unify two things, you
;;establish a relationship between then.
;;A collection of these relationships is
;;called a ‘substitution’. A goal is a
;;function that takes a substitution
;;as a parameter and adds one or more
;;relationships to it."


;;====================================
;; TRS p. ix - Preface
;;====================================

;;TRS (The Reasoned Schemer):
;;"In order to do relational program-
;;ming, we need only two constants:
;;  #s and #u,
;;and only three operators:
;;  ==, fresh, and conde."
;;core.logic:
;;s# and u# are functions, not constants
;;but they always yield the same
;;(boolean) result:
;; nil for u# (fail)
;; truthy for s# (succeed),
;;hence we consider them as constants


;;" #s and #u are reminiscent of the
;;Boolean constants #t and #f in Scheme"

;;core.logic enumerates these
;; _0 _1 _2 etc. - more later

(run* (q) (== true q))
;; => (true)
;;because true is associated with q
;;if (== true q) succeeds.

(run* (q)
      u#
      (== true q))
;; => ()
;;because the expression
;;(run∗ (q) g ... (== true q))
;;has the value ()
;;if the goals g . . . fail.

(run* (q)
  s#
  (== true q))
;; => (true)
;;(a Boolean† value),
;;because the expression
;; (run* (q) g . . . (== true q))

;; In order for the run to succeed, both

(run* (q)

(run* (r)
