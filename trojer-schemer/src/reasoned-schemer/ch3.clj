;; Where does
;; (fresh [d] (resto l d) (listo d))
;; come from?
;; It is an unnesting of (list? (cdr l)).
;; First we take the cdr of l and associate
;; it with a fresh variable d, and then we
;; use d in the recursive call.


;; The First Commandment
;; To transform a function whose value is a
;; Boolean into a function whose value is a
;; goal, replace cond with conde and unnest
;; each question and answer. Unnest the
;; answer #t (or #f) by replacing it with
;; #s (or #u).

;; Why is 0 the value associated with x in
(run* (x)
  (listo [:a :b x :d]))
;; => (_0)
;; When determining the goal returned by
;; list o, it is not necessary to determine
;; the value of x. Therefore x remains
;; fresh, which means that the goal
;; returnedfrom the call to list o succeeds
;; for all values associated with x.
;; When list o reaches the end of its
;; argument, it succeeds. But x does not
;; get associated with any value.

;; In list? each cond line results in a
;; value, whereas in listo each conde
;; line results in a goal. To have each
;; conde result in a goal, we unnest each
;; cond question and each cond answer. Used
;; with recursion, a conde expression can
;; produce an unbounded number of values.
;; We have used an upper bound, 5 in the
;; previous frame, to keep from creating a
;; list with an unbounded number of value
